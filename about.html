        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <img class="about-img" src="./IMG_2160.jpg" alt="cooking" />
        <p>
          I have been cooking since my days in the military but it carried over
          once I went back to the civilian side.When it comes to food we all seem to be in a bubble, I like variety and not all always fine dinning you can find the best spots in not so nice areas but it makes it worth it, especially seeing a happy cook.
